# My Calendar

The `My Calendar` feature is an interactive, customizable calendar view built for managing attendance, leave, and other events within the ERPNext framework. This calendar is part of the `hrms` module and designed for both desktop and mobile viewing, with adaptability to Light and Dark themes.

## Features

- **Customizable View**: 
  - Display event details such as attendance status, holidays, leave types, and special events with color-coded highlights.
  - Fridays are visually distinguished for easy week planning.

- **Dynamic Theme Support**:
  - The calendar adapts to the current user theme (Light or Dark) and detects theme changes in real time, updating without needing a page reload.

- **Employee Filter**:
  - A "Filter" button allows users to view the calendar based on specific employee records, updating the calendar title and events accordingly.

- **Mobile Optimization**:
  - Layouts, font sizes, and event styles adjust automatically to fit mobile devices, ensuring a seamless experience across different screen sizes.

- **Interactive Events**:
  - Events display detailed pop-up information on hover or click, including in-time, out-time, and custom labels like "Late Entry" or "Early Exit."
  - For events with specific actions, such as "Attendance Request," clicking the event directs users to relevant documents or workflows.

- **Event Details Card**:
  - A styled card displays date, time, and status details for selected events, enhancing readability and interaction.

## Installation

1. Ensure `FullCalendar` is loaded within your project, as this library is essential for the calendarâ€™s functionality.
2. Import or reference the `my_calendar.js` file within your `hr plus` module.
3. Verify access to employee and attendance data to enable filtering and event display.

## Usage

- **Theme Settings**: Adjust your ERPNext theme settings to see dynamic updates based on Light or Dark themes.
- **Filtering Events**: Use the "Filter" button on the calendar toolbar to select an employee, refining the calendar display to show only relevant events.
- **Event Interaction**: Click on any event to view detailed information in the event card or to be redirected to the relevant ERPNext document.
